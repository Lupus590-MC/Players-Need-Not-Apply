# Players Need Not Apply

A minecraft server that players are not allowed on, instead they remote control turtles from the ComputerCraft mod.

**Currently in the proof of concept stage.**

<!-- NOTE: recomended by Wojbie on discord as a server host https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/#always-free not all server locations stay free after the trial so it might be a good idea to check with Wojbie when setting up -->

## Game mechanics that turtles can't do

We might look at other mods that just vanilla and CC to fill these gaps.
[progressive peripherals](https://github.com/SirEdvin/ProgressivePeripherals)

* trade with villagers/piglins
* mob spawning
  * mythical agriculture with many of the seeds disabled could fill various gaps
* chunkloading (could use a command computer setup or a peripheral mod that adds chunkloading turtles - or both)
* use the new tables (such as the smithing table)
* enchanting (turtles might not be able to interact with the table and don't have levels so can't anyways, turtles can't use enchanted tools anyhow)
* potions (turtles can make them but can't use them and probably can't throw the splash potions)
* anvils (turtles don't damage tools, so do we need to worry?)
* create golems and respawn the ender dragon?
* go through a nether portal and end portal (maybe players get one turtle per dimention to start with? they could also each have enderchests to send items to each other)
* claim chunks (command computer?)
* modem activation, which means that turtles can't make networks and so item movement/storeage will be difficult

## Should install some popular mods other than CC?

* rf power could be nice
* ore doubling?

## Other things to consider

* weekly world export to spectator mode?
  * someone's going to make a visual stucture eventually, we may as well let people enjoy them
  * connecting to this server could also be the way that people get a turtle on the main world
* Advanced Peripherals is over powered
  * modify AP?

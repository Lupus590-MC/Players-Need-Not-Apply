#  Players Need Not Apply

A minecraft server that players are not allowed on, instead they remote control turtles from the ComputerCraft mod. 

Currently in the proof of concept stage.

# Game mechanics that turtles can't do

We might look at other mods that just vanilla and CC to fill these gaps.

* trade with villagers/piglins
* mob spawning
* chunkloading (could use a command computer setup or a peripheral mod that adds chunkloading turtles - or both)
* use the new tables (such as the smithing table)
* enchanting (turtles might not be able to interact with the table and don't have levels so can't anyways, turtles can use enchanted tools anyhow)
* potions (turtles can make them but can't use them and probably can't throw the splash potions)
* anvils (turtles don't damage tools, so do we need to worry?)
* create golems and respawn the ender dragon?
* go through a nether portal and end portal (maybe players get one turtle per dimention to start with? they could also each have enderchests to send items to each other)
* claim chunks (command computer?)

# Should install some popular mods other than CC?

* rf power could be nice
* ore doubling?

# Other things to consider

* weekly world export to spectator mode?
    * someone's going to make a visual stucture eventually, we may as well let people enjoy them
    * connecting to this server could also be the way that people get a turtle on the main world

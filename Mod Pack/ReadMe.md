## Mc and Forge version

* 1.16.5
* 36.2.0

## mods

* CC:T obviously
* AdvancedPeripherals
  * will probably remove some items and modify recipies
* ProgressivePeripherals
* Digital Items
  * I would have used Ender Storage but there's no way to have CC change the colours/frequency/channel
* Iron Chests, Metal Barrels, Iron Shulker Boxes and Storage Drawers
* Mini Utilities
  * cursed/blessed dirt for mob spawning will help turtles find mobs easier as they can make pens and have the dirt populate it
  * ender ore, easier access to ender pearls, essencial to wireless modems which may be needed more
  * add alternatives to blaze rods?
* Torch Master
  * easier prevention of mob spawning
* Trash Cans
  * easier voiding of items, helps server health
* JEI and Patchouli are included for development, other mods are required as dependencies

## consideratios

* a backup creation mod
* charcoal block?
  * turtle fuel more efficiently
* tiny charcoal?
  * smelting efficiently made easier
* a fluid tank of some kind
  * lava storeage for turtle fuel
  * custom machinery mod?
* bucket filler/emptier
  * custom machinary mod?
* chunk loader
  * turtles have them but players might want a cheap static chunk loader for bases
  * I was going to provide a command computer service to use vanilla's force load command but crops won't grow in those
    * might be able to find/make a mod that changes this behavour
* RF power
* Ore multiplication
  * custom machinery mod?
* mythical agriculture
  * could patch holes with mob farming etc.

# gameplay notes

## spawn equipment

* chest
  * being nice, helps with crafting
* crafting table
* pickaxe
* chunkloader peripheral
* item digitiser?
  * kinda needed to be able to send stuff from the nether/end
  * nether and end turtles just have chunk loader and item digitiser
* fuel
  * or could place them at a tree

## respawning

* players might run out of fuel and want to try again or otherwise brick their turtle
* place chest of turtle's items?
* void the turtle and its inventory?

## other

* might want a websocket for chat (`pnna-chat` websocket)
* and another for anouncing when the server will restart etc. (`pnna-serverInfo` websocket)
  * command blocks (and thus command computers) can't stop the server
* maybe another for requesting chunk loading?
* players by default can break/reprogram another player's turtle, this doesn't sound fair/fun for the player who loses said turtle

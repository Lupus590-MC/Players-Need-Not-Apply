# spawn equipment
* chest
    * being nice, helps with crafting
* crafting table
* pickaxe
* chunkloader peripheral
* item digitiser?
    * kinda needed to be able to send stuff from the nether/end
    * nether and end turtles just have chunk loader and item digitiser
* fuel
    * or could place them at a tree

# respawning
* players might run out of fuel and want to try again or otherwise brick their turtle
* place chest of turtle's items?
